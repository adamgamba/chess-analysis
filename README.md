### Chess Analysis with Python
Statistical analysis of professional chess games (ELO > 2000).

The data set used comes from the KingBase chess database (no longer supported as of Jan. 2021).
This dataset contained **2.2 million games**, **178,000,000 moves**, and was formatted in **.pgn format (portable game notation)** which was specifically designed to standardize chess notation.

A small sample of 242 example games in .pgn notation can be found [here](chess-analysis/example_games.txt).
This project was completed in late 2018 / early 2019.
